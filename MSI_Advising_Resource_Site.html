            <p>At the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI), we are committed to supporting our students'
                academic success by offering a wide array of resources and services. Our academic advising team provides
                personalized guidance to help you navigate your curriculum, select courses, and address any academic
                challenges or questions you may encounter during your studies.</p>

            <P>Academic Advising is a process where students envision, execute, and reflect on their academic plans with
                guidance from a qualified UMSI Academic Advisor. Students share their goals, challenges, and questions
                with their academic advisor, and their academic advisor contributes knowledge of university and program
                requirements, policies, and processes. Together, we develop an academic plan that aligns with the
                student's personal and professional goals.</P>

            <h2>Academic Advising</h2>
            <p>The UMSI Academic Programs and Student Life (APSL) teamâ€™s mission is to empower students to think broadly
                about their education and to create meaningful academic plans and student experiences that will prepare
                them to reach their personal and professional goals. Academic advisors challenge and support students to
                become self-directed learners, informed decision makers and engaged members of the UMSI community and
                beyond. This is achieved in practice through individual conversations, group advising and other
                programs/resources (e.g., Canvas/Coursera sites, academic planning guides, faculty talks). </p>

                academic advisor, current students should refer to their program-specific academic advising site. You
