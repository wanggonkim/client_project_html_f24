            <p>In partnership with our UMSI faculty, the UMSI Peer Tutoring program is an opportunity for UMSI
                students and students taking UMSI courses to engage with peer tutors and receive assistance and
                support in UMSI courses. For more information regarding student support and tutoring, please email
                umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu.<br></p>
            <p>
                The UMSI Academic Programs and Student Life (APSL) team’s mission is to empower students to think
                broadly
                about their education and to create meaningful academic plans and student experiences that will prepare
                them
                to reach their personal and professional goals. Academic advisors challenge and support students to
                become
                self-directed learners, informed decision makers and engaged members of the UMSI community and beyond.
                This
                is achieved in practice through individual conversations, group advising and other programs/resources
                (e.g.,
                Canvas/Coursera sites, academic planning guides, faculty talks).</p>

            <p>The APSL Academic Advising team supports our residential academic programs at UMSI including students in
                the Bachelor of Science in Information, Master of Health Informatics and Master of Science in
                Information. The Online Programs Academic Advising team supports our online learners in the Master of
                Applied Data Science program. Both academic advising teams support our students through scheduled
                appointments via a scheduling system, regularly scheduled drop-in advising appointments and events which
                support students’ academic planning. We also offer academic support via online systems used within UMSI
                such as email, Slack, and Canvas/Coursera announcements. </p>

                <h2>FAQ's: UMSI Peer Tutoring Program</h2>
                <p>How can I schedule a tutoring appointment?</p>
                <p>Students can schedule a tutoring appointment with our available UMSI Peer Tutors or UMSI MADS Peer
                    Tutors via their Google Calendar appointment link. Links can be found under the "Math Peer Tutoring"
                    or "Programming Peer Tutoring" page. Please note that on both the Math and Programming Peer Tutor
                    pages there are peer tutors available for SI and SIADS courses. </p>
                <p>Am I limited on how many appointments I can make with a UMSI Peer Tutor?</p>
                <p>No. Students can schedule multiple appointments with UMSI Peer Tutors. However, if you are finding
                    you need additional support, we encourage you to connect with the UMSI Academic Success Team at
                    umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu to discuss additional resources. </p>
                <p>I am interested in applying to be a UMSI Peer Tutor- who do I contact?</p>
                <p>If you are interested in applying to be a UMSI Peer Tutor, please email UMSI Academic Success at
                    umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu. The UMSI Academic Success Team works closely with our faculty on
                    this process. Typically Peer Tutors are hired at the start of the Fall semester and job postings are
                    available through the UMich Careers website when positions are available. </p>
                <p>How are tutoring appointments available?</p>
                <p>Typically, the Peer Tutors will determine their schedule, but appointments are available via Zoom
                    throughout the week. Students can schedule an appointment via each tutor's individual calendar link.
                </p>
                <p>I am looking for support, but do not see the course I need help with listed under the Peer Tutoring
                    pages. Can I still receive support?</p>
                <p>Our Academic Success Team is constantly looking for ways to support students. Courses rooted in
                    programming and math seem to be the most popular areas students need extra support, but we realize
                    that is not always the case. If you need additional support, please email
                    umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu, so we can discuss additional support available.</p>
                <p>What is the difference between UMSI Peer Tutors and the UMSI Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory?</p>
                <p>The UMSI Peer Tutoring Program is available to students enrolled in UMSI courses and is free of
                    charge to students. UMSI hires these Peer Tutors and they work with our faculty and UMSI Academic
                    Success Team to support students. The Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory was created in an effort to help
                    connect students looking to offer broad tutoring and a fee may be associated with these services,
                    determined by the tutor. UMSI does not oversee the tutors in the Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory but
                    simply maintains the Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory each term.</p>
