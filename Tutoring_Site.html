                <h2>FAQ's: UMSI Peer Tutoring Program</h2>
                <p>How can I schedule a tutoring appointment?</p>
                <p>Students can schedule a tutoring appointment with our available UMSI Peer Tutors or UMSI MADS Peer
                    Tutors via their Google Calendar appointment link. Links can be found under the "Math Peer Tutoring"
                    or "Programming Peer Tutoring" page. Please note that on both the Math and Programming Peer Tutor
                    pages there are peer tutors available for SI and SIADS courses. </p>
                <p>Am I limited on how many appointments I can make with a UMSI Peer Tutor?</p>
                <p>No. Students can schedule multiple appointments with UMSI Peer Tutors. However, if you are finding
                    you need additional support, we encourage you to connect with the UMSI Academic Success Team at
                    umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu to discuss additional resources. </p>
                <p>I am interested in applying to be a UMSI Peer Tutor- who do I contact?</p>
                <p>If you are interested in applying to be a UMSI Peer Tutor, please email UMSI Academic Success at
                    umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu. The UMSI Academic Success Team works closely with our faculty on
                    this process. Typically Peer Tutors are hired at the start of the Fall semester and job postings are
                    available through the UMich Careers website when positions are available. </p>
                <p>How are tutoring appointments available?</p>
                <p>Typically, the Peer Tutors will determine their schedule, but appointments are available via Zoom
                    throughout the week. Students can schedule an appointment via each tutor's individual calendar link.
                </p>
                <p>I am looking for support, but do not see the course I need help with listed under the Peer Tutoring
                    pages. Can I still receive support?</p>
                <p>Our Academic Success Team is constantly looking for ways to support students. Courses rooted in
                    programming and math seem to be the most popular areas students need extra support, but we realize
                    that is not always the case. If you need additional support, please email
                    umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu, so we can discuss additional support available.</p>
                <p>What is the difference between UMSI Peer Tutors and the UMSI Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory?</p>
                <p>The UMSI Peer Tutoring Program is available to students enrolled in UMSI courses and is free of
                    charge to students. UMSI hires these Peer Tutors and they work with our faculty and UMSI Academic
                    Success Team to support students. The Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory was created in an effort to help
                    connect students looking to offer broad tutoring and a fee may be associated with these services,
                    determined by the tutor. UMSI does not oversee the tutors in the Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory but
                    simply maintains the Peer-to-Peer Tutor Directory each term.</p>
