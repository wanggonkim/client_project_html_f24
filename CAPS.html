        <h2>Uwill Teletherapy Services</h2>
        <p>Uwill is an addition to CAPS services that provides students with video, phone, chat, and message sessions with licensed mental health professionals at no cost. This additional counseling option offers students greater flexibility and allows CAPS to expand its service capacity.</p>
        <img src="images/UHS.jpg" alt="UHS Building" width="460"> 
        <p>Uwill provides students with access to a therapist of their choice via the mode of their choice - video, phone, chat or messaging. Teletherapy services are available during the day, as well as evenings, weekends, and holidays. Uwill has licensed mental health professionals available in all 50 states and providers in many countries of the world.</p>
        <p>This service has been successfully used by other counseling centers, including in the Big 10. </p>
        <P>Please see the information below for the situations in which Uwill is a good option for students. Because Uwill teletherapy may not be appropriate for all presenting concerns, please contact CAPS if you have any questions or to determine if Uwill is a good fit for you.</p>
